Table declarations If you want to make queries using SQLAlchemy core, then you'll need to declare your tables in code. This is generally good practice in any case as makes it far easier to keep your database schema in sync with the code that's accessing it. It also allows you to use database migration tools to manage schema changes. import sqlalchemy metadata = sqlalchemy . MetaData () notes = sqlalchemy . Table ( \"notes\" , metadata , sqlalchemy . Column ( \"id\" , sqlalchemy . Integer , primary_key = True ), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"text\" , sqlalchemy . String ( length = 100 )), sqlalchemy . Column ( \"completed\" , sqlalchemy . Boolean ), ) You can use any of the sqlalchemy column types such as sqlalchemy.JSON , or custom column types. Queries You can now use any SQLAlchemy core queries ( official tutorial ). from databases import Database database = Database ( 'postgresql://localhost/example' ) # Establish the connection pool await database . connect () # Execute query = notes . insert () values = { \"text\" : \"example1\" , \"completed\" : True } await database . execute ( query = query , values = values ) # Execute many query = notes . insert () values = [ { \"text\" : \"example2\" , \"completed\" : False }, { \"text\" : \"example3\" , \"completed\" : True }, ] await database . execute_many ( query = query , values = values ) # Fetch multiple rows query = notes . select () rows = await database . fetch_all ( query = query ) # Fetch single row query = notes . select () row = await database . fetch_one ( query = query ) # Fetch single value, defaults to `column=0`. query = notes . select () value = await database . fetch_val ( query = query ) # Fetch multiple rows without loading them all into memory at once query = notes . select () async for row in database . iterate ( query = query ): ... # Close all connection in the connection pool await database . disconnect () Connections are managed as task-local state, with driver implementations transparently using connection pooling behind the scenes. Raw queries In addition to SQLAlchemy core queries, you can also perform raw SQL queries: # Execute query = \"INSERT INTO notes(text, completed) VALUES (:text, :completed)\" values = { \"text\" : \"example1\" , \"completed\" : True } await database . execute ( query = query , values = values ) # Execute many query = \"INSERT INTO notes(text, completed) VALUES (:text, :completed)\" values = [ { \"text\" : \"example2\" , \"completed\" : False }, { \"text\" : \"example3\" , \"completed\" : True }, ] await database . execute_many ( query = query , values = values ) # Fetch multiple rows query = \"SELECT * FROM notes WHERE completed = :completed\" rows = await database . fetch_all ( query = query , values = { \"completed\" : True }) # Fetch single row query = \"SELECT * FROM notes WHERE id = :id\" result = await database . fetch_one ( query = query , values = { \"id\" : 1 }) Note that query arguments should follow the :query_arg style.","title":"Database Queries"},{"location":"database_queries/#database-queries","text":"Databases supports either raw SQL, or queries build using SQLAlchemy core.","title":"Database Queries"},{"location":"database_queries/#table-declarations","text":"If you want to make queries using SQLAlchemy core, then you'll need to declare your tables in code.

Test isolation For strict test isolation you will always want to rollback the test database to a clean state between each test case: database = Database ( DATABASE_URL , force_rollback = True ) This will ensure that all database connections are run within a transaction that rollbacks once the database is disconnected. If you're integrating against a web framework you'll typically want to use something like the following pattern: if TESTING : database = Database ( TEST_DATABASE_URL , force_rollback = True ) else : database = Database ( DATABASE_URL ) This will give you test cases that run against a different database to the development database, with strict test isolation so long as you make sure to connect and disconnect to the database between test cases.

Migrations Because databases uses SQLAlchemy core, you can integrate with Alembic for database migration support. $ pip install alembic $ alembic init migrations You'll want to set things up so that Alembic references the configured DATABASE_URL , and uses your table metadata. In alembic.ini remove the following line: sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname In migrations/env.py , you need to set the 'sqlalchemy.url' configuration key, and the target_metadata variable.

Note that migrations will use a standard synchronous database driver, rather than using the async drivers that databases provides support for. This will also be the case if you're using SQLAlchemy's standard tooling, such as using metadata.create_all(engine) to setup the database tables.
